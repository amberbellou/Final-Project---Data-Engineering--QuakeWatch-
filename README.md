## 🌍 QuakeWatch: Real-time Earthquake Data Pipeline and Dashboard

QuakeWatch is a project I built to bring earthquake data to life in a way that is both useful and easy to explore. Every few hours the system goes out to the USGS Earthquake API, which publishes seismic activity from around the world in real time. Instead of leaving the data as raw messy JSON, QuakeWatch cleans it up, validates it, and organizes it into a structured format that can actually be analyzed. The cleaned data is then stored in a database so that past events are not lost and researchers or curious users can look at historical trends alongside the newest quakes.
From there I wanted to make the data easy to access and visualize. That is why I built a FastAPI service that exposes earthquake information through a set of endpoints anyone can use, whether that is to grab raw numbers, check a health status, or fetch detailed statistics by country. On top of the API I created a Streamlit dashboard that turns the numbers into interactive maps, charts, and tables. You can see the biggest quakes of the day, explore which countries are most affected, or watch how magnitudes have changed over time.
What makes QuakeWatch special is that it runs automatically. I set up an ETL pipeline that updates every six hours so the dashboard and API are always up to date without me needing to manually trigger anything. That means it is not just a class demo, it is a small but complete data system that shows how real world pipelines are designed from extraction all the way to visualization.

## 📖 Project Overview

QuakeWatch is a real-time earthquake monitoring system that collects, processes, and visualizes global seismic activity.  
The goal is to provide a clean, structured dataset and a live dashboard for researchers, analysts, and the public to track earthquakes as they happen.

The pipeline runs automatically every **6 hours** to keep the data fresh.  
This project was designed to demonstrate a full ETL lifecycle, automation with cron, and modern visualization techniques.

The main purpose of QuakeWatch is to demonstrate how a real-world ETL pipeline can be designed and deployed from scratch. Instead of just a one-off script, this project brings together multiple tools and techniques from data engineering:

Data Extraction – Pulls earthquake event data directly from the USGS Earthquake API in GeoJSON format.

Transformation – Cleans the feed, converts timestamps, normalizes fields, and enriches the data by extracting region and country names from raw place strings. Data is validated with Pandera to ensure consistency.

Loading – Stores the transformed data in a relational database for persistence and analysis.

API Layer – A FastAPI service exposes earthquake data as JSON endpoints, making it accessible to other apps or services.

Dashboard – A Streamlit web app visualizes earthquakes with charts, tables, and maps, designed for interactive exploration.

Automation – The pipeline is scheduled with cron to run every six hours, ensuring data stays up to date.

## 🏗 Architecture (How It Works)

QuakeWatch is organized into three core layers:
ETL Pipeline (Extract, Transform, Load)
Extracts raw earthquake events from the USGS feed.
Transforms and validates the data using Pandas and Pandera.
Loads the events into a relational database (SQLite locally, PostgreSQL in deployment).
API (FastAPI)
Serves clean earthquake data directly from the database.
Provides endpoints for recent events, country-level statistics, and health checks.
Includes interactive documentation via Swagger UI at /docs.
Dashboard (Streamlit)
Interactive web application for exploring seismic activity.
Features include:
Recent earthquake tables with filtering.
Magnitude distribution over time.
A map view for global visualization.
Adjustable filters for minimum magnitude and number of rows.
Together, these parts form a complete pipeline: raw data goes in, structured insights come out, and both developers and non-technical users can explore earthquakes in ways that would otherwise require digging through complex JSON feeds.

## 🔧 How I Built It

- **Extraction** – Python script retrieves raw earthquake data from the USGS API.  
- **Transformation** – Data is cleaned, enriched (e.g., extracting country info), validated with [Pandera](https://pandera.readthedocs.io/), and structured for analytics.  
- **Loading** – Transformed events are stored in a SQL database.  
- **API Layer** – [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) service exposes REST endpoints.  
- **Dashboard** – [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) visualizes live earthquake data with maps, charts, and filters.  
- **Automation** – The ETL runs every 6 hours via a scheduled cron job.  

## 🎯 Purpose and Use Cases
QuakeWatch is useful for:
- 🧑‍🔬 Researchers studying seismic trends over time.  
- 🏛️ Governments & disaster-response teams monitoring earthquake activity.  
- 🎓 Educators and students learning about seismology and data pipelines.  
- 🌍 Anyone curious about real-time global earthquake activity.
