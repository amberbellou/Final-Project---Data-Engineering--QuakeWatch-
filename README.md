# 🌍 QuakeWatch — Real-time Earthquake Data Pipeline & Dashboard

QuakeWatch is a data engineering project that ingests, processes, and visualizes earthquake data in near real time.  
It fetches seismic event data from the **USGS Earthquake API**, processes and validates it, stores it in a database, exposes it via a **FastAPI service**, and provides an interactive **Streamlit dashboard** for exploration.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

QuakeWatch is a real-time earthquake monitoring system that collects, processes, and visualizes global seismic activity.  
The goal is to provide a clean, structured dataset and a live dashboard for researchers, analysts, and the public to track earthquakes as they happen.

The pipeline runs automatically every **6 hours** to keep the data fresh.  
This project was designed to demonstrate a full ETL lifecycle, automation with cron, and modern visualization techniques.

---

## 🎯 Purpose and Use Cases
QuakeWatch is useful for:
- 🧑‍🔬 Researchers studying seismic trends over time.  
- 🏛️ Governments & disaster-response teams monitoring earthquake activity.  
- 🎓 Educators and students learning about seismology and data pipelines.  
- 🌍 Anyone curious about real-time global earthquake activity.

## 📌 System Architecture

### 1. ETL Pipeline
- **Extract**: Pulls earthquake event data from the USGS feed.  
- **Transform**: Cleans and validates the data (e.g., country parsing, Pandera schema checks).  
- **Load**: Stores processed events into a local **SQLite database** (PostgreSQL ready).  

### 2. API (FastAPI)
- REST endpoints for:
  - Recent earthquake events  
  - Statistics by country  
  - Service health checks  
- Auto-documented with Swagger UI at **`/docs`**.  

### 3. Dashboard (Streamlit)
- Interactive web app for real-time insights.  
- Includes:
  - 🌎 Map of events  
  - 📊 Magnitude timeline  
  - 📋 Recent events table  
  - 🏆 Top countries by quake count  
  - Filters for magnitude thresholds and row limits.
